# assignment001 Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

(Answer) I feel like I achieved all my objectives here.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

(Answer) I don't believe so. I spent a lot of time this weekend, rewatching previous lesson recordings and youtube video guides. I cut and paste any useful content I find - to make my own "step by step" user guides. This helps me understand each step I'm making along, and also something for me to add to when new discoveries come my way.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

(Answer) I wouldn't say I found any of this "easy" per se. Quite the opposite. It's a steep learning curve for me in many areas. But I'm happy that I'm starting to make some real progress.

Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?

(Answer) I've gone through all kinds of ups and downs this first week. Sometimes absolute despair! Other times Sheer Enlightenment! I can't thank you enough for linking me to Kevin Powell on youtube. What a guru he is! He explains everything so clearly and systematically. Watching him makes me love web development even more. He will be a key source of knowledge for me over these 12 weeks (as well as yourselves of course!). The best thing I've watched of his so far is when he says to look at every single element in a website as just being a block. It's true isn't it.

I would say the nicest thing that's happened to me this weekend is the pennies are finally starting to drop, in many areas of html and css. I've come to realise that anything you type into a html document can be then called/categorized into whatever you want them to be, whether it's divs, sections, headers, footers, etc - they are only called that because "WE" call them that. And once you've labelled them - it then makes it easier to call upon them later and maniuplate as required.

In terms of what could have gone better. I've learned the hard way in this assignment, to focus more at the very beginning - just to get a decent, empty template of a webpage going first, before I then start trying to cram in all the clever bits. I'll get better at this. What went really well was making use of the /\* \*/ tags (in order to label/explain each line of code).I feel this is handy when wanting to locate the right code quickly. Especially when a web site grows and you're trying to locate a bug or conflict. I now understand the importance of keeping a tidy code as well.
